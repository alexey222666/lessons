         <p>No one knows for sure what happened to the ancient Hittite Empire. For nearly <mark>500 years</mark>, its
            dominion
            extended across much of modern Turkey and into Syria and Lebanon. Its kings dwelled in massive stone palaces
            inside a gated capital city. Large-scale farming, sophisticated irrigation systems and far-reaching trade
            networks filled the imperial coffers.</p>
         <br>
         <p>And then, just after 1200 B.C., it vanished. Archaeological investigations suggest that the royal
            administration packed up the palace and fled the capital. The city was abandoned and later burned. Few
            accounts
            from the fractured kingdom remain to explain exactly why.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="text-2">
         <p>But climate data, captured in the rings of long-dead trees, offer a clue. A new analysis published Wednesday
            in the journal Nature shows that the Hittites endured three consecutive years of extreme drought right
            around the time that the empire fell. Such severe water shortages may have doomed the massive farms at the
            heart of the Hittite economy, leading to famine, economic turmoil and ultimately political upheaval,
            researchers say.</p>
         <br>
         <p>“One year of drought is a problem. Two years — it’s a crisis. By three years in a row, perhaps it’s actually
            more than a crisis,” said Sturt Manning, an archaeologist at Cornell University and lead author of the
            Nature study. “Seeing that back-to-back-to-back failure — that’s probably what overthrows a major state.”

            <li>The study is the latest from an accumulating field of research linking the fall of civilizations to
               abrupt
               shifts in Earth’s climate. In the ruins of ancient Egypt, Stone Age China, the Roman Empire, Indigenous
               American cities and countless other locations, experts have uncovered evidence of how floods, droughts
               and
               famines can alter the course of human history, pushing societies to die out or transform.</li>
            <li>As human greenhouse gas emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels, warm the atmosphere and alter the
               lands that modern nations were built on, archaeologists say this research offers both a warning and a
               reassurance. It underscores the peril of increasingly frequent and severe climate disasters. But it also
               points to strategies that might make communities more resilient: cultivating diverse economies,
               minimizing
               environmental impacts, developing cities in more sustainable ways.</li>
            <li>To Müge Durusu-Tanrıöver, an archaeologist at Temple University who was not involved in the newly
               published
               research, the lessons of history are especially relevant after two massive earthquakes ripped through
               Southern Turkey and Syria this week, killing more than 11,000 people and leaving thousands more stranded
               in
               the cold.</li>

         <p>Midas Mound in what was ancient Gordion in Turkey. Timbers were sourced from the mound to help researchers
            determine the climate at the fall of the Hittite empire. (John Marston)</p>

      <div class="text-4">
         <p>Though not climate-related, the quakes provide yet another reminder of the Earth’s power to upend societies
            — and of the need for measures to protect vulnerable people from environmental harms.</p>
         <br>
         <p>“Things like climate change, earthquakes, drought — they are of course realities of our lives,”
            Durusu-Tanrıöver said. “But there are human actions that can be taken to foresee what will happen and behave
            accordingly.”</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="text-5">
         <p>To figure out what happened to the Hittites, Manning and his colleagues turned to millennia-old timbers
            found inside a gigantic tomb in central Turkey. The wood came from juniper trees that had been still
            standing when the Hittite empire fell. Junipers are an especially long-lived species, which meant the growth
            rings within their trunks would contain a record of the weather throughout their life spans.</p>
         <br>
         <p>In the half-century leading up to empire’s collapse, the scientists found, the rings inside the tree trunks
            gradually start to get narrower — suggesting that water shortages were limiting the junipers’ growth.
            Chemical analyses of the kind of carbon captured in the wood also showed how drought altered the trees at
            the cellular level.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="text-6">
         <p>These results jibe with inscriptions on cuneiform tablets from that time in which Hittite officials fretted
            over rising food prices and asked for grain to be sent to their cities. But Manning said the empire — which
            was known for its elaborate water infrastructure projects and massive grain silos in major cities — should
            have been able to survive this “low frequency” drought.</p>
         <br>
         <p>Then, between 1198 and 1196 B.C., the region was struck by three of the driest years in the entire
            1,000-year-long tree ring record. The abrupt spurt of intensely dry weather may have been more than the
            Hittites could bear. Within a generation, the empire had dissolved.</p>
